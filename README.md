# JS_PharmacyPrescriptionApp
Third year university project written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript using Google Firebase functions and database

This application was designed as part of a coursework to help pharmacists handle repeat prescriptions which currently put the onus on the customer and cause lost time for pharmacies. It automates the process of requesting bloodworks and automatically generates a daily list of prescriptions which are due within the next week.
